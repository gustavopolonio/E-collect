# :book: About this Project

This is a marketplace to help people find waste collection points efficiently.

The project ideia was taken from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) NLW and is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any 
feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the E-collect as you wish, either to study or make improvementes!
